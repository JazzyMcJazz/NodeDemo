        <h3>What is Server Side Rendering?</h3>
        <p>
            Server Side Rendering is when a web server converts HTML files into fully
            rendered HTML pages before shipping them to the client in an HTTP response.
        </p>
        <p>
            The counterpart to SSR is Client Side Rendering where the server delivers
            unrendered HTML files for the client to render themselves.

        <h3>Benefits of SSR</h3>
        <p>
            The main benefits of SSR is better Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and
            faster load times which benefits clients that with slow internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            The reason SSR is ideal for SEO is because all static content on the page
            is already rendered by the time web crawlers receive a response from the server.

        <h3>Risks of SSR</h3>
        <p>
            Rendering pages server side can become quite resource intensive for your server in
            situations where your site has a lot of traffic. One way to counter this could be to
            pre-render all content and store it in memory when the server starts. That way everything
            only has to be rendered once. For large sites, however, this might not be ideal.
