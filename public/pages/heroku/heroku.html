        <h3>What is Heroku?</h3>
        <p>
            Heroku is a Cloud Platform as a Service which makes deploying and
            maintaining web applications easy. Setting up a CI/CD pipeline for
            automatic deployment is also possible
        </p>

        <h3>How to Deploy a web app on Heroku?</h3>
        <p>Before you can deploy a Node.js project on Heroku you need to have two things in order:</p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            First, you need to have a
            <span class="lightseagreen monospace">start</span> script in your
            <span class="lightseagreen monospace">package.json</span>. Heroku uses this script to run
            node projects
        </p>
        <code>
            <span class="skyblue">"scripts"</span>: {
            <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="skyblue">"start"</span>: <span class="sandybrown">"node app.js"</span>
            <br/>},
        </code>

        <br/>
        <p>
            Second, because Heroku assigns a dynamic port through the environment you need to set your application to listen on
            <span class="lightseagreen monospace">process.env.PORT</span>. In this example a fallback port has been set as well, which is practical in development
        </p>
        <code>
            <span class="dodgerblue">const</span>
            <span class="deepskyblue">PORT</span> =
            <span class="skyblue">process</span>.<span class="skyblue">env</span>.<span class="deepskyblue">PORT</span>
            || <span class="green">3000</span>;<br/>
            <span class="deepskyblue">app</span>.<span class="ffffcf">listen</span>(<span class="deepskyblue">PORT</span>)
        </code>

        <br/>
        <p>
            Now we are ready to deploy. Go to
            <a target="_blank" href="https://heroku.com/apps">heroku.com</a> and register/login
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Once you are logged in, in the top-right corner click
            <span class="lightseagreen">New > Create new app</span>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <img src="../../img/new_project.png" alt="Click New and then Create New App"/>

        <br/><br/><br/>
        <p>
            One the next page you specify your apps name (it has to
            be unique) and a region and click
            <span class="lightseagreen">Create App</span>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <img src="../../img/create_new_app.png" alt="Input app name and region"/>

        <br/><br/><br/>
        <p>Once you are on your new apps page go to <span class="lightseagreen">Deploy</span> tab</p>
        <br/>
        <img src="../../img/go_to_deploy_tab.png" alt="Go to Deploy tab"/>

        <br/><br/><br/>
        <p>
            You have different options regarding how you get your source code onto Heroku.
            The easiest way is to use GitHub and connect your repository to your Heroku app
        </p>
        <br/>
        <img src="../../img/connect_github.png" alt="Connect your GitHub repository"/>

        <br/><br/><br/>
        <p>
            Once you have found your repo and connected to it, scroll down to
            <span class="lightseagreen">Automatic deploys</span> or
            <span class="lightseagreen">Manual deploy</span> - depending on your preference -
            choose your desired branch to deploy and hit
            <span class="lightseagreen">Deploy Branch</span>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <img src="../../img/deploy_branch.png" alt="Deploy your desired branch"/>

        <br/><br/><br/>
        <p>Congratulations! Your app is now live in the cloud</p>
